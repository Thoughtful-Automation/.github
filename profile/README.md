## Culture at Thoughtful

### The Stuff We’re Made Of

How do you bring people from around the world together to create the workforce of the future? Every day we practice these values, which drive our culture and mission. Are you ready?!

### Our Company Values

- **Experiment always.**

  Don’t let the fear of failure hold you back from doing incredible, original work. We don’t expect perfection on the first swing, just the willingness to keep going until we get it right. It takes grit, a lot of experimentation, and failing fast to optimize learnings.

- **Do less, deliver more.**

  We focus on doing the ***right*** things, not *all* things. Focus on work that creates an outsized impact for our customers and team. We practice ruthless prioritization and intentionally make trade-offs that best serve our customers and mission.

- **We are givers.**

  We put our customers and our team ahead of our personal ambitions. We intentionally give without condition in the spirit of advancing our mission. We won’t succeed with a “gimme” culture, but we will win as a team of endless baton-passers who support each other until the race is won.
